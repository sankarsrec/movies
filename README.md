# Movies List App

An app to display the list of movies

### ASSUMPTIONS
Since themoviedb.org was not responding for a long time,
I have used rapid API for this project

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. App Loads the Splash screen for 1 second & moves to the movies list screen
2. Movies list screen loads the list of movies from Rapid API
3. Pagination is implemented, so 10 movies loads at start and then on each scroll, another set of 10 movies loads
